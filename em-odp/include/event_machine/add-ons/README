Add-ons
-------

This directory contains add-ons and optional APIs for OpenEM.

These are not considered part of OpenEM API definition but some may become such
in the future. The purpose of add-ons is to collect new features that
potentially could be part on OpenEM API in some future release.

Add-ons typically have system specific implementation and may or may not be
supported on a given platform.
add-ons/templates/ provides template headers for a HW specific implementation
types and definitions referenced by a feature API.
